Project 2 Building my own social media analyzer 

1.Define MVP and user stories?
Minimum Viable product, or MVP, is a product design with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. 
In software industries the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product. Design of my MVP and user stories: I will make sure that my MVP aligns with the business objectives of my product. 
Start identifying specific problems that I wanted to solve or improve to enable user preferences. Translate my MVP functionality into plan of developmental action and implement it as soon as possible.

2.Translate user stories to modular stories:
       i) My user stories are defined as Wishbone architecture using universal verification method. Now a day people complaint about their charging capacity in their electronic devices. My using the wishbone architecture this can be corrected to some extent and the battery life will be increased. Converting user stories to modular stories is like a piece of fiction composed of isolated units of information into image and language.
      ii)  The wishbone architecture has a specific terminology which is designes bu rule, recommendation, suggestion,permission and observation.Whenver the active state reaches a source (Vdd) it automatically pushes the logic towards the ground direction by either in positive direction or negative.It is controlled by ASIC (Application specific integrated circuit) a general term that generic array of logic gates or analog building blocks.It can programmed using hardware verification language or verilog.
We humans have a tendency to adapt to a situation not more than 10 days grace period , same it goes with wishbone architecture where it adapts to new environment and make it a possible solution to get new things.
Register transfer logic-A design methology that transfer data to registers,Data is latched in the registers in one or more stagesalong the path of signal propagatiion.The wishbone architecture uses a synchronous RTL design methodology where all registers use a comon clock.
Register transfer level- A discription of computer organization where data transfers to registers to registers ,latch to latch and through logic gates.
